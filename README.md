Problem Statement:
College teaches us more than academic learning. People engage and showcase their talents learn, new skills, sharpen their own, learn as well as teach others too. We are fortunate to have a campus like IIT(ISM), Dhanbad which gives every student opportunities in every field.
For students who are constantly keeping up with academics as well as co-curricular activities it is difficult to manage everything at once. Time management becomes a major factor.
With so many societies, clubs, events, quizzes and fests taking place in our college, IIT(ISM), Dhanbad it can be overwhelming to keep track of everything and participate in all the exciting opportunities available. Things often get missed out on, events clash, and moreover it's difficult for the clubs to be connected with other clubs as well as the students.


Solution:
To tackle this issue, we propose developing an all-in-one website that provides comprehensive information on all the events happening on campus. This website will make it easy for students to stay informed and engaged, enabling them to plan and prioritize their participation in various activities. Its user-friendly design and social media features will ensure that students are always up-to-date with the latest happenings in the college community.
